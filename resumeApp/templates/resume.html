    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        <p>I am a proficient back-end developer with extensive experience across multiple programming languages and technologies. My expertise lies in crafting robust web applications and designing engaging video games. Outside of work, I pursue interests in hiking, surfing, and freediving. Originally from San Diego, California, I graduated from the University of Hawai'i.</p>
        
        <p>My journey into programming began during my sophomore year in college, driven by a passion for developing desktop games for personal enjoyment and sharing with peers. Subsequently, I pursued elective courses in computer science, which not only sharpened my programming skills but also revealed my aptitude and potential in this field.</p>
        
        <p>I am committed to advancing my career in software development, eager to apply my skills and interests in a professional environment. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to innovative projects while continuing to evolve and refine my capabilities.</p>
