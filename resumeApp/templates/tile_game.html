    <h1>Level Function Description</h1>
<p>The level function in Tile Game is a critical component that dynamically generates each maze, ensuring a unique and challenging experience every time you play. Here's an in-depth look at how it works from a programming perspective:</p>

<h2>Level Function Overview</h2>

<p>The level function is designed to create and manage the game's maze structures. It involves several key processes:</p>

<h3>Grid Initialization:</h3> <p>The function starts by initializing a grid that represents the maze layout. Each cell in the grid can be a pathway or a wall, and the size of the grid can vary to adjust the difficulty of the level.</p>

<h3>Maze Generation Algorithm:</h3> <p>A maze generation algorithm, such as Depth-First Search (DFS) or Prim's Algorithm, is employed to carve out a solvable maze.</p> 

<h3>This involves:</h3>
<ul>
<li>from a random point in the grid.</li>
<li>Creating paths by visiting neighboring cells and marking them as part of the maze.</li> 
<li>Ensuring that there is always a path from the start to the finish.</li>
<li>Randomized Obstacles and Power-Ups: To enhance gameplay, the function randomly places obstacles and power-ups within the maze. These elements are strategically positioned to provide challenges and rewards, making each level exciting and unpredictable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Level Difficulty Scaling:</h3> 
<p>As the player progresses, the level function adjusts the complexity of the mazes by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing the grid size.</li>
<li>Adding more obstacles.</li>
<li>Decreasing the frequency of power-ups.</li>
<li>Start and End Points: The function ensures that each maze has clearly defined start and end points. These are placed at opposite ends of the grid to maximize the maze's navigational complexity.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Optimization and Testing:</h3> 
<p>The generated mazes undergo optimization to remove any dead ends or unsolvable paths. Automated testing routines ensure that every maze is both challenging and fair.</p>
